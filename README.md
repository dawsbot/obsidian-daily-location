# Obsidian Daily Location

Start every daily note with the current location. Works together and requires the Core Plugin "Daily notes".

⚠️ This plugin uses your IP address and [a highly trusted remote API](https://ipinfo.io/) to estimate your location. If you are not comfortable with this, stop now.
